# Hi, I’m Heidi 👋

I’m a **full-stack developer** and founder building software that has to work in the real world.

Right now, I’m building **SocialBright** — a secure, multi-tenant case management platform designed for social service agencies. That means production code, real users, real data, and zero tolerance for shortcuts.

## 🧠 What I work with
- Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Python, Django, FastAPI
- Databases: PostgreSQL (schemas, migrations, data modeling)
- Security: authentication, role-based access, encryption, audit logs
- Version control: Git (daily use, clean commits, real workflows)

## 🚀 What I’m building
- 🟦 **SocialBright** — a full SaaS platform with dashboards, reporting, documents, scheduling, and compliance built in
- Secure APIs and multi-tenant architecture
- Features designed for people who actually rely on them to do their jobs

## 🛠 How I code
- I care about readability and maintainability
- I prefer solving real problems over building toy apps
- I believe good commits tell a story

## ✨ Fun fact
I genuinely enjoy debugging. It’s just logic puzzles with higher stakes.
